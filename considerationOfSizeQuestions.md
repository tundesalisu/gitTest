As an architect, you might want to ask the following questions to the customer:

1. **Data Size**: What is the size of the data being migrated? This will help determine if AWS Lambda's temporary storage of 512 MB is sufficient or if AWS Batch, which can handle larger data sizes, is needed.

2. **Processing Time**: What is the expected processing time for the post-migration activities? AWS Lambda functions have a maximum execution time of 15 minutes, so if the activities are expected to take longer, AWS Batch would be a better choice.

3. **Concurrency Requirements**: How many concurrent executions are expected? AWS Lambda has concurrency limits which might be a constraint if high concurrency is required.

4. **Complexity of Post-Migration Activities**: Are the post-migration activities simple CRUD operations or complex data processing tasks? AWS Lambda is great for simple tasks, but for more complex tasks that require heavy computation or multiple steps, AWS Batch might be more suitable.

5. **Cost**: What is the budget for the post-migration activities? AWS Lambda charges for the total execution time, while AWS Batch charges for the compute resources used.

6. **Error Handling**: What should happen if a post-migration activity fails? AWS Batch provides automatic retries and more robust error handling capabilities.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**: What are the requirements for monitoring and logging? Both AWS Lambda and AWS Batch integrate with CloudWatch, but the specifics of what needs to be logged and monitored could influence the choice.

8. **Security**: Are there any specific security requirements? Both services offer different security controls, so understanding the security requirements is important.

9. **Maintenance**: Who will be maintaining the post-migration activities? AWS Lambda might be easier to maintain for teams already familiar with serverless, while AWS Batch might be more familiar to teams with a background in batch processing.

10. **Integration**: How will the post-migration activities integrate with the rest of the system? Depending on the existing system architecture, one service might integrate more seamlessly than the other.

These questions should help guide the decision between using AWS Lambda or AWS Batch for post-migration activities.



The approach of deciding between AWS Lambda and AWS Batch based on factors such as data size, processing time, complexity of tasks, cost, error handling, monitoring, logging, security, maintenance, and integration is indeed a smart and commonly used one. 

However, the "best" approach can vary depending on the specific context and requirements of the project. Here are a few additional considerations that might be relevant:

1. **Future Scaling**: Consider the future growth of your application. If the data size or processing time is expected to increase significantly in the future, it might be better to choose AWS Batch from the start, even if AWS Lambda could handle the current load.

2. **Development Time**: AWS Lambda functions can be quicker to develop and deploy, especially for simple tasks. If time-to-market is a critical factor, this might influence the decision.

3. **Team Expertise**: The familiarity and comfort level of your team with AWS Lambda and AWS Batch can also be a deciding factor. If your team has more experience with one technology, it might be more efficient to use that technology.

4. **Use of Other AWS Services**: If you're heavily using other AWS services, you might want to consider how well AWS Lambda and AWS Batch integrate with those services. For example, AWS Lambda might be a better choice if you're using API Gateway, while AWS Batch might be better if you're using ECS.

5. **Consistency**: If you're already using AWS Lambda or AWS Batch elsewhere in your system, it might be beneficial to use the same technology for consistency and ease of maintenance.

Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The best approach is to understand the strengths and limitations of each service, and choose the one that best fits your specific needs.


If you want to only have the instances available when triggered and then deleted after, you can consider using AWS Fargate with AWS Batch. AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Fargate makes it easy for you to focus on building your applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

With AWS Batch on Fargate, you only pay for the actual vCPU and memory resources consumed by the containerized jobs, not for the whole EC2 instances. This means you don't pay for idle time between jobs. 

Here's how you can set up AWS Batch to use Fargate:

1. Create a new compute environment in AWS Batch and select Fargate or Fargate Spot as the compute resource type.
2. Create a new job queue that uses the Fargate compute environment.
3. Submit your jobs to the Fargate job queue.

When a job is submitted to the Fargate job queue, AWS Batch will automatically launch a Fargate task to run the job. When the job is finished, the Fargate task is stopped and you stop paying for it.

Please note that AWS Batch support for Fargate is currently available in select AWS regions only. Also, there are some differences in functionality between Fargate and EC2 compute environments in AWS Batch, so make sure to review the AWS documentation to understand if Fargate is a good fit for your use case.
