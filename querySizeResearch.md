The `SVV_TABLE_INFO` view in Amazon Redshift provides a summary of information about tables in a database. Here are the columns it provides:

1. `schema`: The name of the schema that contains the table.
2. `table_id`: The ID of the table.
3. `table`: The name of the table.
4. `encoded`: Whether the table is encoded (Y) or not (N).
5. `diststyle`: The distribution style of the table: EVEN, KEY, or ALL.
6. `sortkey1`: The first column in the sort key.
7. `sortkey_num`: The number of columns in the sort key.
8. `size`: The size of the table in megabytes.
9. `pct_used`: The percentage of total system capacity that is used by the table.
10. `empty`: The number of 1 MB disk blocks that are not being used.
11. `unsorted`: The percentage of rows that are not sorted.
12. `stats_off`: The staleness of the statistics, from 0 (fresh) to 100 (out of date).
13. `tbl_rows`: The number of rows in the table.
14. `skew_sortkey1`: The skew ratio of the first column in the sort key.
15. `skew_rows`: The skew ratio of the rows.

tundesalisu: what is aws batch

GitHub Copilot: AWS Batch is a cloud service from Amazon Web Services (AWS) that is designed to simplify batch computing in the cloud. It enables developers, scientists, and engineers to easily and efficiently run hundreds of thousands of batch computing jobs on AWS. 

AWS Batch dynamically provisions the optimal quantity and type of compute resources (e.g., CPU or memory optimized instances) based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted. With AWS Batch, there is no need to install and manage batch computing software or server clusters that you use to run your jobs, allowing you to focus on analyzing results and solving problems.

tundesalisu: can you create me a lambda python script that queries a redshift fpr candidate records and this lambda pythn is utilized via aws batch using typyscript

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I can provide you with a basic example of how you might structure your AWS Lambda function in Python to query a Redshift database, and how you might call this Lambda function from a TypeScript script. 

Firstly, here's a simple Python script for AWS Lambda to query a Redshift database:

```python
import psycopg2
import os

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(
        dbname=os.environ['DB_NAME'], 
        user=os.environ['DB_USER'], 
        password=os.environ['DB_PASSWORD'], 
        port=os.environ['DB_PORT'], 
        host=os.environ['DB_HOST']
    )

    cur = conn.cursor()
    cur.execute("SELECT * FROM candidates")
    rows = cur.fetchall()

    for row in rows:
        print(row)

    conn.close()
```

This script connects to a Redshift database using the psycopg2 library, executes a SQL query to fetch all records from a table named "candidates", and then prints out each row.

You would need to set the environment variables `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT`, and `DB_HOST` in the AWS Lambda function configuration to match your Redshift database settings.

Now, to call this Lambda function from a TypeScript script, you would use the AWS SDK for JavaScript. Here's a basic example:

```typescript
import { Lambda } from 'aws-sdk';

const lambda = new Lambda();

const params = {
  FunctionName: 'your_lambda_function_name', // replace with your Lambda function name
  InvocationType: 'RequestResponse'
};

lambda.invoke(params, function(err, data) {
  if (err) {
    console.log(err, err.stack);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

This script invokes the specified AWS Lambda function and logs the response or any error that occurs.

Please note that AWS Batch is not directly involved in this process. AWS Batch is used for running batch computing jobs, and while it can be used in conjunction with AWS Lambda, it's not used to "call" Lambda functions. If you want to run your Lambda function on a schedule or in response to certain events, you might want to look into AWS EventBridge or AWS Step Functions.

tundesalisu: how will i use aws with this script. show a complete aws cdk script

GitHub Copilot: To use AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) with TypeScript, you would first need to install the AWS CDK and initialize a new project. Then, you can define your infrastructure in a TypeScript file. Here's an example of how you might define a stack that includes a Lambda function and a Redshift cluster:

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';
import * as redshift from '@aws-cdk/aws-redshift';
import * as secretsmanager from '@aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager';

export class MyCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Define the Redshift cluster
    const cluster = new redshift.Cluster(this, 'RedshiftCluster', {
      masterUser: {
       

 master

Username: 'admin',
        masterPassword: secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretNameV2(this, 'MasterUserPassword', 'RedshiftMasterPassword'),
      },
      vpc: new ec2.Vpc(this, 'Vpc'),
      defaultDatabaseName: 'MyDatabase',
    });

    // Define the Lambda function
    const myFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
      handler: 'my_handler',
      environment: {
        DB_NAME: 'MyDatabase',
        DB_USER: 'admin',
        DB_PASSWORD: cluster.secret?.secretValue.toString() || '',
        DB_PORT: cluster.clusterEndpoint.port.toString(),
        DB_HOST: cluster.clusterEndpoint.hostname,
      },
    });
  }
}
```

This script defines a new CDK stack that includes a Redshift cluster and a Lambda function. The Lambda function is configured to use the Python 3.8 runtime, and its code is loaded from a directory named "lambda" in the same directory as the CDK script. The handler for the Lambda function is named "my_handler", which should be a function in your Python script.

The Redshift cluster is configured with a master username of "admin" and a password that is retrieved from AWS Secrets Manager. The database name is "MyDatabase".

The environment variables for the Lambda function are set to the database name, username, password, port, and hostname for the Redshift cluster.

Please replace `'my_handler'` with your actual lambda function handler and `'lambda'` with the path to your lambda function code. Also, replace `'RedshiftMasterPassword'` with the actual secret name where your Redshift master password is stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you might need to adjust the VPC and subnet configurations, add security groups, or configure additional properties for the Redshift cluster or Lambda function.

tundesalisu: how will leverage aws batch to run this script. show me the complete script

GitHub Copilot: AWS Batch is used to run batch computing workloads on the AWS Cloud. It's not typically used to directly run AWS Lambda functions, but you can create a Docker container that triggers your Lambda function and then run that container as a job in AWS Batch.

Here's an example of how you might define an AWS CDK stack that includes an AWS Batch job definition, job queue, and compute environment, in addition to the Lambda function and Redshift cluster:

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as lambda from '@aws-cdk/aws-lambda';
import * as redshift from '@aws-cdk/aws-redshift';
import * as secretsmanager from '@aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager';
import * as batch from '@aws-cdk/aws-batch';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';

export class MyCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {

    const cluster = new redshift.Cluster(this, 'RedshiftCluster', {
      masterUser: {
        username: 'admin',
        masterPassword: secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretNameV2(this, 'MasterUserPassword', 'RedshiftMasterPassword

'),


      },
      vpc: new ec2.Vpc(this, 'Vpc'),
      defaultDatabaseName: 'MyDatabase',
    });

    // Define the Lambda function
    const myFunction = new lambda.Function(this, 'MyFunction', {
      runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_8,
      code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('lambda'),
      handler: 'my_handler',
      environment: {
        DB_NAME: 'MyDatabase',
        DB_USER: 'admin',
        DB_PASSWORD: cluster.secret?.secretValue.toString() || '',
        DB_PORT: cluster.clusterEndpoint.port.toString(),
        DB_HOST: cluster.clusterEndpoint.hostname,
      },
    });

    // Define the Batch Compute Environment
    const myComputeEnvironment = new batch.CfnComputeEnvironment(this, 'MyComputeEnvironment', {
      computeEnvironmentName: 'MyComputeEnvironment',
      type: 'MANAGED',
      serviceRole: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSBatchServiceRole', // replace with your AWS Batch service role ARN
      computeResources: {
        type: 'EC2',

        maxvCpus: 16,
        desiredvCpus: 4,
        instanceTypes: ['optimal'],
        subnets: ['subnet-0abcd1234efgh5678'], // replace with your subnet ID
        securityGroupIds: ['sg-0abcd1234efgh5678'], // replace with your security group ID
        instanceRole: 'ecsInstanceRole', // replace with your instance role
      },
      state: 'ENABLED',
    });

    // Define the Batch Job Queue
    const myJobQueue = new batch.CfnJobQueue(this, 'MyJobQueue', {
      jobQueueName: 'MyJobQueue',
      state: 'ENABLED',
      priority: 1,
      computeEnvironmentOrder: [
        {
          order: 1,
          computeEnvironment: myComputeEnvironment.computeEnvironmentName,
        },
      ],
    });

    // Define the Batch Job Definition
    const myJobDefinition = new batch.CfnJobDefinition(this, 'MyJobDefinition', {
      jobDefinitionName: 'MyJobDefinition',
      type: 'container',
      containerProperties: {
        image: 'my-docker-image', // replace with your Docker image
        vcpus: 1,
        memory: 2000,
        command: ['python', 'my_script.py'], // replace with your command
        environment: [
          {
            name: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
            value: 'my-access-key', // replace with your access key
          },
          {
            name: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
            value: 'my-secret-key', // replace with your secret key
          },
          {

            value: myFunction.functionName,
          },
        ],
      },
    });
  }
}
```

In this script, the Docker image specified in the job definition should be an image that includes the AWS CLI and a script to invoke your Lambda function. The command to run in the Docker container should be the command to invoke your Lambda function using the AWS CLI.

Please replace `'my_handler'` with your actual lambda function handler and `'lambda'` with the path to your lambda function code. Also, replace `'RedshiftMasterPassword'` with the actual secret name where your Redshift master password is stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you might need to adjust the VPC and subnet configurations, add security groups, or configure additional properties for the Redshift cluster, Lambda function, or AWS Batch resources.

tundesalisu: how instead of triggering  the lambda, I will want the python script in the in container instead of lambda. show me the complete way to write a script in a container and have it created in aws batch .

GitHub Copilot: Sure, you can certainly run your Python script directly in a Docker container as part of an AWS Batch job. Here's how you might do it:

First, you would need to create a Dockerfile that sets up an environment with Python and any necessary libraries, and includes your Python script. Here's an example Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir psycopg2-binary

CMD ["python", "./my_script.py"]
```

This Dockerfile uses the Python 3.8 image, sets the working directory to `/app`, copies the current directory into the Docker image, installs the `psycopg2-binary` package, and sets the command to run your Python script.

You would need to build this Docker image and push it to a Docker registry that your AWS Batch jobs can access, such as Amazon ECR.

Next, you would define your AWS CDK stack. Here's an example that includes a Redshift cluster and an AWS Batch job definition, job queue, and compute environment:

```typescript
import * as cdk from '@aws-cdk/core';
import * as redshift from '@aws-cdk/aws-redshift';
import * as secretsmanager from '@aws-cdk/aws-secretsmanager';
import * as batch from '@aws-cdk/aws-batch';
import * as ec2 from '@aws-cdk/aws-ec2';
import * as iam from '@aws-cdk/aws-iam';

export class MyCdkStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // Define the Redshift cluster
    const cluster = new redshift.Cluster(this, 'RedshiftCluster', {
      masterUser: {
        username: 'admin',
        masterPassword: secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretNameV2(this, 'MasterUserPassword', 'RedshiftMasterPassword'),
      },
      vpc: new ec2.Vpc(this, 'Vpc'),
      defaultDatabaseName: 'MyDatabase',
    });

    // Define the Batch Compute Environment
    const myComputeEnvironment = new batch.CfnComputeEnvironment(this, 'MyComputeEnvironment', {
      computeEnvironmentName: 'MyComputeEnvironment',
      type: 'MANAGED',
      serviceRole: 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AWSBatchServiceRole', // replace with your AWS Batch service role ARN
      computeResources: {
        type: 'EC2',
        minvCpus: 0,
        maxvCpus: 16,
        desiredvCpus: 4,
        instanceTypes: ['optimal'],
        subnets: ['subnet-0abcd1234efgh5678'], // replace with your subnet ID
        securityGroupIds: ['sg-0abcd1234efgh5678'], // replace with your security group ID
        instanceRole: 'ecsInstanceRole', // replace with your instance role
      },
      state: 'ENABLED',
    });

    // Define the Batch Job Queue
    const myJobQueue = new batch.CfnJobQueue(this, 'MyJobQueue', {
      jobQueueName: 'MyJobQueue',
      state: 'ENABLED',
      priority: 1,
      computeEnvironmentOrder: [
        {
          order: 1,
          computeEnvironment: myComputeEnvironment.computeEnvironmentName,
        },
      ],
    });

    // Define the Batch Job Definition
    const myJobDefinition = new batch.CfnJobDefinition(this, 'MyJobDefinition', {
      jobDefinitionName: 'MyJobDefinition',
      type: 'container',
      containerProperties: {
        image: 'my-docker-image', // replace with your Docker image
        vcpus: 1,
        memory: 2000,
        command: ['python', 'my_script.py'], // replace with your command
        environment: [
          {
            name: 'DB_NAME',
            value: 'MyDatabase',
          },
         

 {


            name: 'DB_USER',
            value: 'admin',
          },
          {
            name: 'DB_PASSWORD',
            value: cluster.secret?.secretValue.toString() || '',
          },
          {
            name: 'DB_PORT',
            value: cluster.clusterEndpoint.port.toString(),
          },
          {
            name: 'DB_HOST',
            value: cluster.clusterEndpoint.hostname,
          },
        ],
      },
    });
  }
}
```

In this script, the Docker image specified in the job definition should be the image that you built and pushed to your Docker registry. The command to run in the Docker container should be the command to run your Python script.

Please replace `'RedshiftMasterPassword'` with the actual secret name where your Redshift master password is stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you might need to adjust the VPC and subnet configurations, add security groups, or configure additional properties for the Redshift cluster or AWS Batch resources.

tundesalisu:  image: 'my-docker-image'
 what is this 

GitHub Copilot: The `image: 'my-docker-image'` line in the AWS Batch Job Definition refers to the Docker image that will be used to run your job. This image should contain all the code and dependencies needed to run your job.

In the context of AWS Batch, this image should be stored in a Docker container registry that AWS Batch can access. This could be Docker Hub, but more commonly in AWS, you would use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

To use an image from ECR, you would replace `'my-docker-image'` with the URI of the image in ECR. This URI would look something like this: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-docker-image:tag`, where:

- `123456789012` is your AWS account ID
- `us-west-2` is the AWS region where your ECR repository is located
- `my-docker-image` is the name of the ECR repository
- `tag` is the tag of the Docker image you want to use (for example, `latest`)

So, you need to build your Docker image, push it to a registry such as ECR, and then replace `'my-docker-image'` with the URI of your image in the registry.

tundesalisu: my-docker-image is the name of the ECR repository
show me how to create one in ecr completely with python script trying to redshift

GitHub Copilot: To create an Amazon ECR repository and push a Docker image to it, you would typically use the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK. Here's an example of how you might do it using the AWS CLI and a Python script:

First, create a Dockerfile for your Python script:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir psycopg2-binary

CMD ["python", "./my_script.py"]
```

Next, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t my-docker-image .
```

Then, create the ECR repository:

```bash
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-docker-image
```

Authenticate Docker to your ECR registry:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region region | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com
```

Replace `region` with your AWS region and `123456789012` with your AWS account ID.

Tag your Docker image with the ECR repository URI:

```bash
docker tag my-docker-image:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-docker-image:latest
```

Finally, push the Docker image to the ECR repository:

```bash
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-docker-image:latest
```

Now, you can use the ECR repository URI (`123456789012.dkr.ecr.region.amazonaws.com/my-docker-image:latest`) in your AWS Batch job definition.

Please replace `'my_script.py'` with your actual python script and make sure it's in the same directory as your Dockerfile. Also, replace `region` with your actual AWS region and `123456789012` with your actual AWS account ID.

Please note that you need to have the AWS CLI and Docker installed on your machine to run these commands.

tundesalisu: can you query a redshift database to the retrieve memory  size of a table

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can query a Redshift database to retrieve the size of a table. Here's an example of how you might do it:

```sql
SELECT
    "table", 
    size
FROM 
    SVV_TABLE_INFO
WHERE 
    "table" = 'your_table_name';
```

Replace `'your_table_name'` with the name of the table you're interested in. The `size` column in the result set will give you the size of the table in megabytes.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to run this query. The `SVV_TABLE_INFO` view is visible to all users, but only shows information about tables that the current user has permission to view.

tundesalisu: what information does the SVV_TABLE_INFO
itemize it all for me with the desciption 

GitHub Copilot: The `SVV_TABLE_INFO` view in Amazon Redshift provides a summary of information about tables in a database. Here are the columns it provides:

1. `schema`: The name of the schema that contains the table.
2. `table_id`: The ID of the table.
3. `table`: The name of the table.
4. `encoded`: Whether the table is encoded (Y) or not (N).
5. `diststyle`: The distribution style of the table: EVEN, KEY, or ALL.
6. `sortkey1`: The first column in the sort key.
7. `sortkey_num`: The number of columns in the sort key.
8. `size`: The size of the table in megabytes.
9. `pct_used`: The percentage of total system capacity that is used by the table.
10. `empty`: The number of 1 MB disk blocks that are not being used.
11. `unsorted`: The percentage of rows that are not sorted.
12. `stats_off`: The staleness of the statistics, from 0 (fresh) to 100 (out of date).
13. `tbl_rows`: The number of rows in the table.
14. `skew_sortkey1`: The skew ratio of the first column in the sort key.
15. `skew_rows`: The skew ratio of the rows.
16. `max_varchar`: The maximum length of any VARCHAR column in the table.
17. `sortkey1_enc`: The encoding type of the first column in the sort key.
18. `sortkey1_pct`: The percentage of the first column in the sort key that is populated.
19. `sortkey1_coll`: The collation of the first column in the sort key.
20. `sortkey1_min`: The minimum value in the first column of the sort key.
21. `sortkey1_max`: The maximum value in the first column of the sort key.
22. `sortkey1_nvals`: The number of distinct values in the first column of the sort key.
23. `sortkey1_nulls`: The number of null values in the first column of the sort key.

Please note that the `SVV_TABLE_INFO` view is visible to all users, but only shows information about tables that the current user has permission to view.

tundesalisu: okay can show  me complete script that use the memory size of a table to decide if query should be ran from a lambda function or aws batch.

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's a Python script that uses the `psycopg2` library to connect to a Redshift database, query the size of a table, and then decide whether to run a query using AWS Lambda or AWS Batch based on the size of the table:

```python
import psycopg2
import boto3

# Connect to the Redshift database
conn = psycopg

2

.connect(
    dbname='your_database',
    user='your_username',
    password='your_password',
    host='your_host',
    port='your_port'
)

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Execute the query to get the size of the table
cur.execute("""
    SELECT

In this script, replace `'your_database'`, `'your_username'`, `'your_password'`, `'your_host'`, `'your_port'`, `'your_table_name'`, `'your_lambda_function_name'`, `'your_query'`, `'your_job_name'`, `'your_job_queue'`, and `'your_job_definition'` with your actual values.

Please note that this is a simplified example and might need to be adjusted to fit your specific needs. For example, you might need to handle exceptions, log results, or configure additional parameters for the AWS Lambda or AWS Batch clients. Also, you should securely manage your database credentials, for example by storing them in AWS Secrets Manager.
